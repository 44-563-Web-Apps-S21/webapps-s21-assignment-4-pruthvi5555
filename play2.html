        <h3>And the play continues</h3>
            <p class="stage-direction">Enter GLOUCESTER and LADYANNE</p>
<h6 class="name GLOUCESTER">GLOUCESTER</h6>
<p class="speech">Lady, you know no rules of charity,<br>
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</p>
<h6 class="name LADYANNE">LADYANNE</h6>
<p class="speech">Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:<br>
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</p>
<h6 class="name GLOUCESTER">GLOUCESTER</h6>
<p class="speech">But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</p>
<h6 class="name LADYANNE">LADYANNE</h6>
<p class="speech">O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!</p>
<h6 class="name GLOUCESTER">GLOUCESTER</h6>
<p class="speech">More wonderful, when angels are so angry.<br>
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,<br>
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,<br>
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.</p>
<h6 class="name LADYANNE">LADYANNE</h6>
<p class="speech">Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,<br>
For these known evils, but to give me leave,<br>
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.</p>
