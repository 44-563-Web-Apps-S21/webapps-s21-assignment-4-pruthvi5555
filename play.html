            <h3>The Life and Death of Richards the Third </h3>
            <h5>SCENE II. The same. Another street. </h5>

        <h6> <p class="name LADYANNE">LADYANNE</h6>    
<p class="speech">Set down, set down your honourable load,<br>
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,<br>
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament<br>
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.<br>
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!<br>
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!<br>
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!<br>
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,<br>
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,<br>
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,<br>
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!<br>
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,<br>
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.<br>
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!<br>
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!<br>
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!<br>
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,<br>
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,<br>
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,<br>
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!<br>
If ever he have child, abortive be it,<br>
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,<br>
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect<br>
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;<br>
And that be heir to his unhappiness!<br>
If ever he have wife, let her he made<br>
A miserable by the death of him<br>
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!<br>
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,<br>
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;<br>
And still, as you are weary of the weight,<br>
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.</p>
<p class="stage-direction">Enter GLOUCESTER--<p>

<h6 class="name GLOUCESTER">GLOUCESTER</h6>
<p class="speech">Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.</p>
<h6 class="name LADYANNE">LADYANNE</h6>
<p class="speech">What black magician conjures up this fiend,<br>
To stop devoted charitable deeds?</p>
<h6 class="name GLOUCESTER">GLOUCESTER</h6>
<p class="speech">Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,<br>
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.</p>
<h6 class="name Gentleman">Gentleman</h6>
<p class="speech">My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.</p>
<h6 class="name GLOUCESTER">GLOUCESTER</h6>
<p class="speech">Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:<br>
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,<br>
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,<br>
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</p>
<h6 class="name LADYANNE">LADYANNE</h6>
<p class="speech">What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?<br>
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,<br>
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.<br>
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!<br>
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,<br>
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.</p>
<h6 class="name GLOUCESTER">GLOUCESTER</h6>
<p class="speech">Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.</p>
<h6 class="name LADYANNE">LADYANNE</h6>
<p class="speech">Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;<br>
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,<br>
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.<br>
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,<br>
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.<br>
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds<br>
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!<br>
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;<br>
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood<br>
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;<br>
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,<br>
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.<br>
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!<br>
O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!<br>
Either heaven with lightning strike the<br>
murderer dead,<br>
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,<br>
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood<br>
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!</p>
